Curtis Peterson, a strong, vital man in his late twenties, and his wife Marie want to start a family. Tragedy strikes when Curtis is paralyzed in a construction accident. Meanwhile, another family welcomes an addition to its household. Teenager Steve Barnett adopts an 8 week old puppy to train as part of a church project. The Barnett family is to house-train Banner for a year. Then the dog would be returned to the Kansas Specialty Dog Service, where it will be trained to assist the disabled and visually impaired. Steve's sister, 8 year old Emily, ends up taking care of Banner, and falls in love with the dog. Her happiness is offset by the tragic circumstances affecting Curtis and Marie. When Marie takes a job as a waitress to support the family, Curtis is left to sit at home alone, wallowing in self pity. Fate intervenes when Steve's father stops at a diner, where he meets Marie and suggests she call KSDS. She does so, despite the reluctance of her husband. Trouble ensues when Emily runs away with Banner to eccentric Aunt Edna's.","audienceRating":4.3,"year":2000,"tagline":"puppy love","thumb":"/library/metadata/6197/thumb/1669736652","art":"/library/metadata/6197/art/1669736652","duration":5430421,"originallyAvailableAt":"2000-02-25","addedAt":1663082894,"updatedAt":1669736652,"audienceRatingImage":"imdb://image.rating","chapterSource":"media","Media":[{"id":14576,"duration":5430421,"bitrate":2266,"width":636,"height":480,"aspectRatio":1.33,"audioChannels":2,"audioCodec":"aac","videoCodec":"h264","videoResolution":"480","container":"mp4","videoFrameRate":"24p","optimizedForStreaming":0,"audioProfile":"lc","has64bitOffsets":true,"videoProfile":"constrained baseline","Part":[{"id":66017,"key":"/library/parts/66017/1652375127/file.mp4","duration":5430421,"file":"/home/plex/movies/More Than Puppy Love (2002) {imdb-tt0263761}/More Than Puppy Love (2002) {imdb-tt0263761}.mp4","size":1540679920,"audioProfile":"lc","container":"mp4","has64bitOffsets":true,"hasThumbnail":"1","optimizedForStreaming":false,"videoProfile":"constrained baseline"}]}],"Genre":[{"tag":"Drama"},{"tag":"Family"}],"Director":[{"tag":"Tom Whitus"}],"Writer":[{"tag":"Tom Whitus"}],"Country":[{"tag":"United States of America"}],"Role":[{"tag":"Diane Ladd"},{"tag":"Pamela Bach"},{"tag":"Craig Benton"}]},{"ratingKey":"6198","key":"/library/metadata/6198","guid":"plex://movie/5d776832103a2d001f5670d8","studio":"New Line Cinema","type":"movie","title":"Mortal Kombat","contentRating":"PG-13","summary":"Based on the popular video game of the same name \"Mortal Kombat\" tells the story of an ancient tournament where the best of the best of different Realms fight each other.
